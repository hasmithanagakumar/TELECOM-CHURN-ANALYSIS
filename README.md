The extracted CUSTOMER CHURN project folder contains the following key files inside a subfolder named New folder:

archive (28).zip – Likely contains the dataset.

smarted report 1.docx – Probably a written report or documentation.

Untitled24.ipynb – A Jupyter notebook, likely containing the data analysis or model development.

Based on these contents, here's a sample README.md tailored for a GitHub project on customer churn analysis:
